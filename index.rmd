### About the Author: 
My name is Jake Dreyfous and I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, UT. Growing up in Utah, I have had the privilege of exploring incredible landscapes throughout the West (like the picture below), which helped harbor my interest in fly-fishing, skiing, camping, hiking. These places and activities also shaped my choice to study Conservation Biology and pursue a career in the life sciences.
